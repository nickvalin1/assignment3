<h2>Sole Survivor 2: The Journey Home</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Pilot your spaceship through an asteroid field. Be careful, your ship can only take so many hits. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The players should feel challenged and anxious trying to dodge the asteroids with frantic music playing in the background.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Arcade survival game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The up key moves down, the down key moves up. Use these controls to dodge the incoming asteroids. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The goal of this prototype is to use randomized objects and use custom hitboxes. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Test your reactions when the controls are flipped to dodge the asteroids. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game follows an astronaut from USA, Earth. He was the first individual to step foot on an exoplanet, the newly discovered planet MSP-1. MSP-1 has a large quantity of a valuable resource that Earth desperately needs, anti-gravity bubbles. As such, the US government poured billions into sending a team to MSP-1 to collect those bubbles, but a ship malfunction left the game's protagonist as the only survivor. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
After collecting the bubbles and repairing his ship, the astronaut must pilot his ship home, but not being an engineer, he mistakenly reversed the controls of his ship. Additionally, he failed to completely fix the ship's navigation system. As such, he finds himself caught in an asteroid field that he must navigate to find his way home. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is Jan Allbeck and the students in CS-325.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
The game can go on infinitely, but likely will not last longer than a minute. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Hugging the top or bottom of the screen can be an effective strategy, but can also leave you cornered. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
background.jpg from wikipedia, asteroid.png from clipshrine.com, explosion.png and spaceship.png from clipartlord.com, explosion.wav from soundbible.com, music.wav is UltraDrive by Ras-Al-Ghul from freemusicarchive.org 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game most closely resembles a combination of asteroid and the kiwi game from assignment 2.
